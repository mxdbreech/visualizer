# Visualizer 

Scene:

There will be one head (non-animated for now in the middle). 

Stereo mode: There will be 2 speakers each speaker animating a waveform of some sort
Atmos mode: A sphere will enclose the head and react to audio

Audio: We want to handle audio as external for now.

Controls: We want a player of some sort. Dolby Visualizer site demonstrates this very well.
